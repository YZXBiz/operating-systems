## üîç Critical Issues (Require Immediate Fix)

### 1. Code Error in Concurrency Section

**Location:** `docs/concurrency/chapter3-locks.md` - Section 4.7 (Fetch-and-Add)

**Issue:** Typo in pseudocode
```c
// WRONG (current)
int FetchAndAdd(int *ptr) {
    int old = *old;  // ‚ùå Should be *ptr
    *ptr = old + 1;
    return old;
}

// CORRECT (should be)
int FetchAndAdd(int *ptr) {
    int old = *ptr;  // ‚úÖ Fixed
    *ptr = old + 1;
    return old;
}
```

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Prevents compilation
**Impact:** One pseudocode example; concept explanation is correct
**Fix Time:** 30 seconds

---

### 2. Incorrect Chapter References in Navigation

**Location:** `docs/persistence/chapter8-journaling.md` and `chapter12-distributed-systems.md`
