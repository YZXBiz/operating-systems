# üßµ Concurrency

_Master concurrent programming: threads, locks, synchronization, and beyond_

---

## üìñ About This Section

Concurrency is one of the most challenging and important topics in operating systems and systems programming. These chapters transform complex concurrent programming concepts into understandable, practical knowledge through:

- **Progressive learning** - Each chapter builds naturally on previous concepts
- **Visual execution traces** - See exactly how race conditions and synchronization work
- **Real-world examples** - Learn from actual bugs in MySQL, Apache, Mozilla, and OpenOffice
- **Practical API reference** - Complete pthread API coverage with working examples

> **üí° Why Concurrency Matters**
>
> Modern systems are fundamentally concurrent: multi-core CPUs, web servers handling thousands of requests, mobile apps running background tasks, databases managing simultaneous transactions. Understanding concurrency isn't optional - it's essential for building correct, performant software.

## üí° Key Insights

### The Fundamental Challenge
Concurrency introduces **non-determinism** - the same program can produce different results on different runs. This violates our expectation that computers are deterministic machines.

### Two Core Problems
1. **Mutual Exclusion** - Preventing concurrent access to shared resources (solved by locks/semaphores)
2. **Coordination** - Waiting for conditions to become true (solved by condition variables/semaphores)

### Three Critical Rules
1. **Always hold a lock** when accessing shared data
2. **Always use while loops** (not if statements) with condition variables
3. **Avoid deadlock** through consistent lock ordering or other strategies

### The Tradeoff
- **Coarse-grained locking**: Simple, correct, but poor parallelism
- **Fine-grained locking**: Maximum parallelism, but complex and error-prone
- **Lock-free**: Ultimate performance, ultimate complexity

## üîß Practical Resources

### Essential APIs (POSIX Threads)

**Thread Management**
```c
pthread_create()   // Create new thread
pthread_join()     // Wait for thread completion
```

**Mutual Exclusion**
```c
pthread_mutex_init()      // Initialize lock
pthread_mutex_lock()      // Acquire lock
pthread_mutex_unlock()    // Release lock
pthread_mutex_destroy()   // Clean up lock
```

**Coordination**
```c
pthread_cond_init()       // Initialize condition variable
pthread_cond_wait()       // Wait for condition
pthread_cond_signal()     // Wake one waiter
pthread_cond_broadcast()  // Wake all waiters
pthread_cond_destroy()    // Clean up condition variable
```

**Semaphores**
```c
sem_init()     // Initialize semaphore
sem_wait()     // Decrement (P operation)
sem_post()     // Increment (V operation)
sem_destroy()  // Clean up semaphore
```

### Compilation
```bash
gcc -o program program.c -Wall -pthread
```

### Debugging Tools
- **gdb** - Debugger with thread support
- **valgrind --tool=helgrind** - Race condition detector
- **valgrind --tool=drd** - Thread error detector
- **ThreadSanitizer** - Dynamic race detector

## üéì Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will:

‚úÖ **Understand** how threads work and why they're needed
‚úÖ **Recognize** race conditions and other concurrency bugs
‚úÖ **Use** locks, condition variables, and semaphores correctly
‚úÖ **Design** thread-safe data structures

‚úÖ **Avoid** common pitfalls like deadlock
‚úÖ **Choose** between threading models (threads vs events)
‚úÖ **Reason** about concurrent execution confidently

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Using `if` instead of `while` with condition variables** - Always recheck conditions!
2. **Returning pointers to stack variables** from threads - Use heap allocation
3. **Forgetting to initialize locks/condition variables** - Leads to undefined behavior
4. **Inconsistent lock ordering** - Causes deadlock
5. **Spinning instead of blocking** - Wastes CPU cycles
6. **Racing on flag variables** - Use proper synchronization primitives
7. **Not checking return codes** - Errors fail silently
8. **Holding locks too long** - Destroys parallelism

## üìñ Historical Context

The foundations of concurrent programming were laid by pioneers like:

- **Edsger Dijkstra** - Semaphores, mutual exclusion, THE operating system
- **Tony Hoare** - Monitors, CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)
- **Leslie Lamport** - Logical clocks, distributed systems theory
- **Maurice Herlihy** - Transactional memory, lock-free algorithms

Their work in the 1960s-1980s established the principles we still use today.
