# üíæ Persistence

_Master storage systems: from I/O devices to distributed file systems_

---

## üìñ About This Section

Persistence is about making data survive beyond program execution. These chapters cover the entire storage stack - from hardware devices to file system abstractions - transforming complex storage concepts into practical, understandable knowledge through:

- **Bottom-up learning** - Build from device hardware ‚Üí disk management ‚Üí file systems ‚Üí distributed systems
- **Real-world systems** - Study actual file systems (FFS, ext3, LFS, ZFS) and their design tradeoffs
- **Performance analysis** - Understand latency, throughput, and optimization techniques
- **Reliability engineering** - Learn crash consistency, RAID, checksums, and recovery mechanisms

> **üí° Why Persistence Matters**
>
> Every application needs to store data: databases, file systems, cloud storage, photo libraries, version control. Understanding how storage works - from individual disk operations to distributed file systems - is essential for building reliable, high-performance systems. This knowledge directly impacts your ability to debug performance issues, design scalable architectures, and make informed technology choices.

## üí° Key Insights

### The Storage Hierarchy
**Speed vs Capacity vs Cost** - Each layer makes tradeoffs:
- **Registers/Cache**: Fast, tiny, expensive (nanoseconds, KB-MB)
- **DRAM**: Moderate, medium, moderate (microseconds, GB)
- **SSD**: Slower, larger, cheaper (microseconds, TB)
- **HDD**: Slow, huge, cheapest (milliseconds, TB)
- **Tape/Cloud**: Slowest, unlimited, pennies (seconds-minutes, PB)

### Three Fundamental Challenges

1. **Performance Gap** - Disks are 100,000√ó slower than memory
   - *Solution*: Caching, prefetching, scheduling, parallelism

2. **Crash Consistency** - System crashes mid-update
   - *Solution*: Journaling, copy-on-write, careful ordering

3. **Reliability** - Hardware fails, data corrupts
   - *Solution*: RAID, checksums, replication, scrubbing

### The Core Tradeoff
- **Durability**: Data must survive crashes (fsync, journaling)
- **Performance**: Can't wait for every write to disk
- **Balance**: Clever techniques (write-back cache, group commit, async replication)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Forgetting fsync()** - Buffered writes aren't durable until flushed
2. **Assuming atomicity** - File operations aren't atomic without care (TOCTTOU bugs)
3. **Ignoring failure modes** - Disks fail, corruption happens, plan for it
4. **Poor locality** - Random access is 100√ó slower than sequential
5. **Over-synchronous I/O** - Waiting for every write kills performance
6. **Ignoring alignment** - Misaligned I/O triggers extra operations
7. **Not using O_DIRECT for databases** - Bypass cache when you have your own
8. **Assuming instant metadata** - Even metadata updates take time
