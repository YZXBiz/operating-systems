# Virtualization 🔄

_How operating systems create the illusion of infinite resources_

---

## 📖 About This Section

This section covers **virtualization**—the mechanisms and policies that allow operating systems to create powerful illusions on top of limited physical resources. You'll learn how the OS virtualizes both the CPU (creating the illusion of infinite processors) and memory (creating the illusion of infinite, private memory for each process).
